## tkLOR

This is a stupid client for reading LOR, written on versatile Tcl/Tk/Tile.

## To use it you must install:

*   Tcl 8.4 or 8.5
*   Tk
*   Tile (not in Tk 8.5)
*   Tcllib

## Hints:

*   Install Tk 8.5 to get better look of fonts on X11
*   You can specify variables in a command-line. For example, command:

    # wish8.4 tkLOR.tcl -configDir=/home/jopa/prog/tkLOR

    Will run tkLOR with specified config directory to /home/jopa/prog/tkLOR.

## For Debian GNU/Linux:

# aptitude install tcl8.4 tk8.4 tcllib tk-tile
or
# aptitude install tcl8.5 tk8.5 tcllib

## For Micro$oft Window$:

Tested on ActiveTcl 8.4.17(equipped with Tile) and ActiveTcl 8.4.13 with Tile installed separately.
