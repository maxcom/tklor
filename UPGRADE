If you are upgrading from 0.x.y branch, this information is for you.

Since 1.0.0, tkLOR uses file location agreement described in "XDG Base Directory Specification" version 0.6 as published on http://freedesktop.org.

Now all configuration files located in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tkLOR (or in $HOME/.config/tkLOR if corresponding environment variable is not defined or empty) instead of $HOME/.tkLOR in older versions.

Similary, message cache are now located in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/tkLOR (or in $HOME/.cache/tkLOR if corresponding environment variable is not defined or empty) instead of $HOME/.tkLOR/topics in older versions.

You can use this simple set of shell commands to move your config files and message cache to new location:

	mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/tkLOR"
	mkdir -p "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/tkLOR"

	mv $HOME/.tkLOR/threads/* "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/tkLOR"
	mv $HOME/.tkLOR/topics "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/tkLOR"
	mv $HOME/.tkLOR/* "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/tkLOR"
	rmdir "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/tkLOR/threads"
	rmdir "$HOME/.tkLOR"
