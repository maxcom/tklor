## tkLOR

This is a stupid client for reading LOR, written on versatile Tcl/Tk/Tile.

## To use it you must install:

*   Tcl 8.4 or 8.5
*   Tk
*   Tile (not in Tk 8.5)
*   Tcllib

## Hints:

*   Install Tk 8.5 to get better look of fonts on X11

*   You can specify variables in a command-line. For example, command:

    # wish8.5 tkLOR.tcl -configDir=/home/jopa/prog/tkLOR -cacheDir=/home/jopa/prog/tkLOR/cache

    Will run tkLOR with specified config directory to /home/jopa/prog/tkLOR.

*   If you have problems like "Error in startup script: can't find package
    gaa_lambda 1.0", try to run in the following way:

    # wish tkLOR.tcl -libDir=/home/jopa/prog/tkLOR/lib

*   If on your system 'tclsh' executable located outside $PATH, use -tclshPath command-line key.

    # /usr/local/tcltk/wish85 tkLOR.tcl -tclshPath=/usr/local/tcltk/tclsh85

## For Debian GNU/Linux:

# aptitude install tcl8.5 tk8.5 tcllib
or
# aptitude install tcl8.4 tk8.4 tcllib tk-tile

## For Micro$oft Window$:

Tested on ActiveTcl 8.4.17(equipped with Tile) and ActiveTcl 8.4.13 with Tile installed separately.

## For Mac OS X:

*   install ActiveTcl from http://www.activestate.com/store/freedownload.aspx?prdGuid=f0cd6399-fefb-466e-ba17-220dcd6f4078
*   install tcllib from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12883
*   add a symlink to /usr/local/bin/wish8.5 in any directory in $PATH or add /usr/local/bin into PATH environment variable.
*   run by command "/usr/local/bin/wish8.5 /path/to/tkLOR -libDir=/path/to/tkLOR/lib -tclshPath=//usr/local/bin/tclsh8.5"
